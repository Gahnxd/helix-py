## helixdb-py
We're building a python library around Helix-DB to simplify building quick and easy RAG applications
to run both locally and in the cloud. HelixDB-Py is meant to simply the process of feeding your private
documents into an open source llm to get the best responses for your use case.

### todo/roadmap
- goal 1: load up index, search and get vectors, insert vectors, delete vectors
- goal 2: embedding model pipeline, process docs
- goal 3: connect with a model downloaded via huggingface lib

- what a helixdb-py script should look like (pseudo):
```python
import helixdb
from helix_queries import *
db = HelixClient()
docs = HNSWLoader('path to documents dir')
db.load_hnsw(docs) # load_hnsw is an ep from helix_queries generated by helix-cli

import huggingface
model = huggingface.import('llama3.2:1b')
rag = HelixRag(model, docs)
while True: prompt()
```
- need a way to talk to helix-db, most likely via an http connection
- llm responses -> embedding -> search -> feed into llm response
- comment all functions so documentation is super easy
- write tests for everything
